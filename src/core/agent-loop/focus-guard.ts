 * the agent reasoned about. When a target window is known (the subtask anchor)
 * and the current foreground is a DIFFERENT process, we raise the target first
 * so the click lands on it instead of an overlapping window (the recurring
 * "click hit the Task Console" failure). No-op when no target is set or the
